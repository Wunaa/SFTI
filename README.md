### Here is all the credits that i know so far most of the downloads are discord attachments so i dont know where to find them
- [FrontiersAnimDecompress](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/FrontiersAnimDecompress)
- [SkythTools](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SkythTools)

## How do i use this 
Download the Zip from the [Recent Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Wunaa/SFTI/releases) or on gamebanana, After this you open up the .exe in the folder If you get a pop up saying that you need Net 3 download that or else the application wont work then its simple from there you can download what you need and choose where you want to save it
