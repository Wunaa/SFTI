<h2>
A application that has the base Frontiers modding tools all in 1 place to download instead of looking for them
</h2>

### Here is all the credits that i know so far most of the downloads are discord attachments so i dont know where to find them
- [FrontiersAnimDecompress](https://github.com/WistfulHopes/FrontiersAnimDecompress)
- [SkythTools](https://github.com/blueskythlikesclouds/SkythTools)

## How do i use this 
Download the Zip from the [Recent Releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Wunaa/SFTI/releases) or on [gamebanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12797), After this you open up the .exe in the folder If you get a pop up saying that you need Net 3 download that or else the application wont work then its simple from there you can download what you need and choose where you want to save it


### Important (for tool makers in this application)

-None of your Tool files are in this they all this to a direct download link from github or the discord download link provided 
-Even after that if you want it Remove or you dont see your name for credit just let me know on the [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/tools/12797) page
